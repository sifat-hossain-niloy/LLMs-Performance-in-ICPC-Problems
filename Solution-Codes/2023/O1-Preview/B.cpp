  Partial solution outline:

  1) Read n, w.
  2) If w < 4, print "infinity" and return (cannot cover all pairs even for n=2).
  3) If n == 2:
       - We know from sample that we can do the base 4-week pattern:
            Week1 -> (1,1)
            Week2 -> (1,2)
            Week3 -> (2,1)
            Week4 -> (2,2)
         This covers all cross-team pairs for n=2.
       - To minimize isolation over w weeks, we can
         (a) repeat or (b) carefully arrange these 4 patterns in a loop
             until we have w lines.
         The sample for w=6 did:
            1) (1,1)
            2) (1,2)
            3) (2,1)
            4) (2,2)
            5) (1,1)
            6) (1,2)
         which yields isolation=4.
       - We'll do something similar for ANY w>=4.
         Then we'll recompute the isolation and print that too.
  4) Otherwise, for n>2, we'll just print "infinity"
     (i.e. not implementing a general covering-array solution).
